# walletBT
This walletBT mobile crypto wallet was developed using React Native and Ethers for the Ethereum network. We are using the Expo managed workflow for the app development.
The current implementation of the walletBT is just for the Sepolia Test Network. But it can be easily implemented for the Mainnet as well.

# How to Replicate the walletBT
## First, clone the application inside your development machine
```
git clone https://github.com/Druk-Information-and-Technology/walletBT.git walletBT
cd walletBT
npm i
```
## .env File
Create a .env file in the project's root and define the INFURA_SEPOLIA_API and ETHERSCAN_API_KEY environment variables.
```
INFURA_SEPOLIA_API=value
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=value
```

Both the APIs can be created from the respective website free of cost. However, it has limitations in its use for the free tier.
